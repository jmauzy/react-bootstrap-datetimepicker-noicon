react-bootstrap-datetimepicker-noicon
===============================

This project is a fork of https://github.com/quri/react-bootstrap-datetimepicker with a slightly different appearance. The datepicker icon has been removed from the input field and the entire field is now clickable to bring up the datepicker. The location of the datepicker has also been lowered slightly to prevent obstruction of the field while typing.


Usage
===============================

Installation :
```
npm install react-bootstrap-datetimepicker-noicon
```

Then
```javascript
var DateTimeField = require('react-bootstrap-datetimepicker-noicon');

...

render: function() {
  return <DateTimeField />;
}
```
See [Examples](examples/) for more details.
